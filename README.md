# chatbot

This repository contains two versions of a simple chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to common inputs and provides basic conversational abilities.

## Features

- Recognizes common greetings, farewells, and user queries.
- Can tell jokes, respond to questions about its name and age, and provide motivational quotes.
- Uses a basic rule-based approach (mini_bot_1.py).
- Uses random responses for a more varied experience (mini_bot_2.py).

## Files

- **mini_bot_1.py** – A basic chatbot with predefined responses.
- **mini_bot_2.py** – An improved chatbot with a dictionary of responses and randomization.
